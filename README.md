### A responsive daily calendar app for scheduling your workday

![Demo](./Assets/Images/demo.gif)

Currently deployed at [GitHub Pages](https://joeldore.github.io/Daily-Planner/)

---
## Features

- Color-coded time blocks distinguish past, in-progress, and upcoming events
- App uses uses [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to automatically update with accurate time & date
- Easily save events to local storage for future access
---

## Reflection
- Working with Moment.js was simpler than JavaScript date methods, but in the future I may look into modern alternatives (e.g. Day.js).
- The condensed format of jQuery allowed me to better organize logic and build the desired functionality more quickly than vanilla JavaScript

---
## Future Development

- Expand calendar functionality to allow scheduling events for future dates
